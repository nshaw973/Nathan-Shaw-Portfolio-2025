export const aboutMe = `
Hello! I'm Nathan Shaw, a passionate and driven web developer 
with a strong foundation in modern web technologies. I recently 
graduated from the UCI Coding Bootcamp, where I gained hands-on 
experience with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), 
as well as other tools like MySQL and GraphQL. I enjoy working on 
small-scale personal projects to challenge myself, explore new ideas, 
and continuously refine my skills. Outside of coding, 
I’m an avid gamer and love building custom PCs, 
which has deepened my understanding of hardware and software 
integration. Feel free to check out my projects to see what I’ve been working on!
